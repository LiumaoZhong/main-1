\chapter{Learning Local Dependencies}
\label{cha:LearnSL}

\begin{itemize}
    \item linguistics: explanatory adequacy directly tied to learning
    \item what is learning? what can be learned? languages, not grammars (e.g.\ we don't care if grammars have bigrams in different order)
    \item what are our parameters?
    \item learning in the limit from positive text
    \item text
    \item converge
    \item lattice learner
    \item what this paradigm ignores: cognitive load, needed sample size, frequency/indirect negative evidence, prosody, semantics, order of presentation
    \item notice how we generalize from finite set to infinite one due to how grammar is structured
\end{itemize}
