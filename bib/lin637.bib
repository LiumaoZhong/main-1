		  many of the extant conditions & relations proposed for
		  X-bar theory by various researchers. Arguments for the
		  elimination of the deep-structure level of representation
		  are developed, & a streamlined version of projection & a
		  version of the strict cycle are considered in its place. It
		  is further proposed that the surface-structure level of
		  representation may be eliminated & several types of
		  evidence for surface-structure are shown to have acceptable

		  minimalist treatment to the reconstruction operation & to

  abstract	= {Beginning in the mid-fifties and emanating largely form
		  MIT, and approach was developed to linguistic theory and to
		  the study of the structure of particular languages that
		  diverges in many respects from modern linguistics. Although
		  this approach is connected to the traditional study of
		  languages, it differs enough in its specific conclusions
		  about the structure and in its specific conclusions about
		  the structure of language to warrant a name, "generative
		  grammar".
		  
		  Various deficiencies have been discovered in the first
		  attempts to formulate a theory of transformational
		  generative grammar and in the descriptive analysis of
		  particular languages that motivated these formulations. At
		  the same time, it has become apparent that these
		  formulations can be extended and deepened. The major
		  purpose of this book is to review these developments and to
		  propose a reformulation of the theory of transformational
		  generative grammar that takes them into account. The
		  emphasis in this study is syntax; semantic and phonological
		  aspects of the language structure are discussed only
		  insofar as they bear on syntactic theory.}
